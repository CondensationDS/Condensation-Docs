	<p>Objects are stored on <a href="strip">strips</a>, which may be disk partitions, or raw (unpartitioned) disks. The standalone server can handle multiple strips, and treats them independently. Strips can be added and removed dynamically.</p>

	<h2>Strip configuration</h2>
	<p>In the "strips" folder, each strip is linked with a symbolic link:</p>
	<div class="hscroll box"><pre>some-partition-rw -&gt; /dev/sda4
other-partition-ro -&gt; /dev/sda5
ssd-rw -&gt; /dev/sdb</pre></div>
	<p>The links can be given any name, but must end in either "-rw" (for read-write strips) or "-ro" (for read-only strips).</p>

	<h2>Adding a strip</h2>
	<p>To add a strip while the server is running, create a new symbolic link:</p>
	<div class="hscroll box"><pre>ln -s /dev/sda6 new-strip-rw</pre></div>
	<p>and reload the configuration:</p>
	<div class="hscroll box"><pre>sudo cn-standalone-server-reload</pre></div>
	<p>Alternatively, you may send the SIG_USR1 signal to the main server process to reload the configuration.</p>
	<p>Since the standalone server keeps strips open at all times, modifying the symbolic links while the server is running won't cause any harm.</p>

	<h2>Removing a strip</h2>
	<p>Removing a strip is very similar to adding, except that we rename an existing link:</p>
	<div class="hscroll box"><pre>mv strip-to-remove-rw strip-to-remove-free
sudo cn-standalone-server-reload</pre></div>
	<p>The server will proceed to copying all active objects of that strip onto other strips. When done, the symbolic link is renamed to ".strip-to-remove-free" (with a dot at the beginning).</p>
	<p>You may shut down, restart, or reconfigure the server while a strip is being freed. To stop freeing the strip, simply rename the strip back to a name ending with "-rw" or "-ro", and reload the configuration.</p>

	<h2>Preparing a strip</h2>
	<p>To initialize a volume as strip, use "cn-format-strip":</p>
	<div class="hscroll box"><pre>sudo cn-prepare-strip /dev/sda4</pre></div>
	<p>This formats the strip (i.e. destroys any existing file system on it) by writing the first strip checkpoint.</p>

	<h2>Using files</h2>
	<p>A strip can be stored as a single file rather than a block device. The data layout within the file corresponds exactly to that of a block device.</p>
	<p>This is less efficient, but does not require a separate partition, or root privileges for that. In a production environment, it is recommended to use block devices (raw disks or partitions).</p>

	<h2>Memory requirements <span class="maturity">to be adapted</span></h2>

	<p>How many users a single machine can serve highly depends on their access patterns and intensity. However, the following numbers will help you calculating a rough estimate for your particular scenario.</p>

	<p>The server needs the following amount of RAM:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>40 bytes per object in the hash index; that is 1 GB of RAM per 25 million objects. Note that Condensation keeps the index completely in memory.</li>
		<li>100 kB of RAM per TCP connection, including the kernel structures and buffers.</li>
		<li>2 MB of wired RAM per thread. Note that Condensation uses an event-based design with asynchronous IO. Only about 2 threads per processor core should be started for optimal performance.</li>
		<li>200 bytes per box, as they are kept in memory, too.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Hence, 8 GB of RAM should be enough for up to 100 million objects and 10'000 connections.</p>

	<p>The next bottleneck could be the size and throughput of the disks. This, however, can easily be mitigated by attaching more disks. A Condensation server can easily handle a few dozen of them. Objects are written sequentially (which is also optimal for wear-leveling), with an overhead of just 41 bytes per object. Some additional space on each disk is required to save copies of the index from time to time.</p>

	<p>The final bottleneck is the network interface, which should have enough throughput to deliver the requested objects.</p>
