	<p>When losing an actor (e.g. through a lost device), its own private data a priori lost as well. There are two safety nets, however: <i>actor groups</i> and <i>entrusted actors</i>.</p>

	<h2>Seamless recovery through actor groups</h2>
	<p>An actor is usually part of an <a href="/actors/actor-group/">actor group</a>. All actors within the same group share and synchronize their private data.</p>
	<p>If at least one <a href="/actors/actor-group/#status">active</a> actor remains in the group, this actor will have a (nearly) complete copy of the private data. Recovery is seamless: if the device is replaced, a new actor is created on the new device, and <a href="/actors/actor-group/#add-member">added to the group</a>.</p>
	<p>Using a <a href="/actors/key-management/#backup-actor">backup actor</a> will greatly increase the probability that an active actor remains in the group.</p>

	<h2>Recovery through an entrusted actor</h2>
	<p>An actor may <a href="/actors/entrusted-actors/">entrust</a> another actor (e.g. a close friend, or a notary) with the data. The entrusted actor can decrypt the actor's private data to recover it.</p>
