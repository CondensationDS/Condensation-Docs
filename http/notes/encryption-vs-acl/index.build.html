	<div class="todo">Perhaps call this whole section "Access model", show how the access model works (perhaps with a schema), then compare it to ACLs.</div>
	<p>Condensation's access model is based on encryption rather than ACLs. Instead of restricting access through a set of rules, access is restricted through encryption.</p>
	<p>This has several advantages:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>With encryption, access rights are applied to <b>the data itself</b> rather than to resources holding data (e.g. file, or a folder).</li>
		<li>Documents are shared through <b>message-passing</b> rather than shared resources.</li>
		<li>Derived work (e.g. from a template) is <b>private by default</b>, until explicitly shared.</li>
		<li>Managing ACLs tends to be difficult. Message-passing is <b>easier to use</b>, and far <b>less error-prone</b>.</li>
		<li>System administrators do not have access to the data of the employees (and managers), unless the data is explicitly shared with them.</li>
		<li>Encryption allows for data sharing and synchronization in a fully distributed setting.</li>
	</ul>
