	<p>Condensation is strictly separated in a mutable and an immutable part:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An account with its <b>mutable</b> boxes defines the state of a user. Account data rarely exceeds 10 kiB of storage space. Such a compact state representation is easy to manage and synchronize.</li>
		<li>
			<p style="margin-top: 0">The actual data is stored as large hash table with <b>immutable</b> objects. Such hash tables are highly scalable, as their entries can be partitioned, cached, and mirrored.</p>
			<p>Note that objects are inherently immutable. If an existing object is modified, its hash changes, making it a different object.</p>
			<p>Similarly, object trees are inherently immutable. If any object of the tree is modified, the hashes of all ancestors (including the object itself) up to the root change, making it a different tree.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This separation is a very fundamental architectural choice of Condensation. Features such as efficient versioning, fast transactional synchronization, and deduplication are directly related to that.</p>
