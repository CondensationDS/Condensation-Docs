	<p>An attacker may deliberately submit objects with a wrong hash to a store, in an attempt to poison the cache. If store accepts such objects, it will claim to have objects that it does not actually have.</p>

	<h2>Preventing poisoning at the store</h2>
	<p>Stores can avoid poisoning simply by checking the SHA-256 hash of each incoming object.</p>
	<p>Alternatively, the store may defer this check until the first <i>has object</i> request, or until an object with the same hash is submitted.</p>

	<h2>Preventing poisoning at the client</h2>
	<p>If the client does not trust the store, it must avoid <i>has object</i> requests, and instead request the bytes of each object through a <i>get object</i> request, and verify the hash manually.</p>

	<h2>Storage errors</h2>
	<p>Conceptually, store poisoning is equivalent to data loss. In fact, errors in the underlying storage system may also result in objects with wrong hashes.</p>
