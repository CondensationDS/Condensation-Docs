	<p>On top of that, a user can mirror his/her data by synchronizing it onto another server. The user thereby sends the root hash of his tree to a second server, which starts copying the missing objects. This is usually done with a delay of a few minutes to a few hours. Should the main server fail, the user only loses a few minutes or hours of his work, which is often acceptable.</p>

	<p>This setup emerges naturally when people are working on different devices that are kept synchronized.</p>

	<p>Note that mirroring and object scattering are orthogonal. </p>
