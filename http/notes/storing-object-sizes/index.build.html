	<p>A Condensation <a href="/stores/store/">store</a> does not provide any function to obtain the size of an object. The result of such a function would not be verifiable by the client anyway, which greatly limits its usefulness.</p>
	<p>To reliably measure the size of an object, a client must download the object and verify its <a href="/notes/data-integrity/">integrity</a>.</p>
	<p>Applications may store the size of relevant objects or subtrees (e.g. photo collection) as part of their private data. Since objects and subtrees are immutable, this is straightforward.</p>
