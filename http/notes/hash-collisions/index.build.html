	<p>The hash of a <a href="/serialization/object/">Condensation object</a> is calculated by applying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-256">SHA-256</a> hash function on the object's content. SHA-256 is a cryptographic one-way function, compressing a byte sequence of arbitrary length to a 256-bit sequence.</p>

	<p>Quite obviously, this is not a one-to-one function: different byte sequences may yield the same hash, and thus produce a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_collision">collision</a>.</p>

	<p>For all we know, SHA-256 has excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance">collision resistance</a>. The probability that two arbitrary byte sequences yield the same hash is only 1 in 2<sup>256</sup> (&approx; 1.2 × 10<sup>77</sup>), and no efficient algorithm is known to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack">construct sequences with the same hash value</a>.</p>

	<p>If everyone on earth (7 billion people) generated 1 million objects per second over a period of 1 million years, it would still be very unlikely (&approx; 10<sup>-18</sup>) to observe even a single collision. For collisions to become likely, one would need to generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox#Probability_table">approximately 2<sup>128</sup></a> objects.</p>

	<p>Hence, we can ignore collisions for all practical purposes.</p>
