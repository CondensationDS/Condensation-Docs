	<p>On <a href="/actors/envelope/">envelopes</a>, actor hashes are shortened to 24 bytes (192 bits) to prevent actor hash scavenging.</p>

	<p>A bot could try to discover large amounts of actor hashes by repeating the following procedure:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>List the messages of a known actor.</li>
		<li>Read all envelopes, and scan them for actor hashes.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Step <i>1</i> is possible on stores with a lenient box listing policy, where any actor can list any box. Step <i>2</i> would be possible if full actor hashes were mentioned on the envelopes.</p>

	<p>By shortening actor hashes to 24 bytes, the above cycle is interrupted.</p>
