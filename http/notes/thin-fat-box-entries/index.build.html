	<p>A Condensation box entry is a hash that points to an envelope.</p>

	<p>In theory, boxes could store envelopes (fat entries) instead of hashes pointing to envelopes (thin entries). This, however, would have the following disadvantages:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Envelopes are typically between 1 and 20 KiB in size. Storing this amount of data is significantly more complex as compared to storing a (fixed-size) 32-byte hash.</li>
		<li>A list request with a few hundred entries would amount to several MiB of data. Hence, a more complex box listing function (e.g. partial enumeration) would be necessary.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Thin entries therefore simplify the store design. Since envelopes are immutable, they can be treated as regular objects.</p>
