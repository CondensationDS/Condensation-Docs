	<p>Condensation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID_(computer_science)">ACID compliant</a>. The following discussion applies to the public and private data of an actor, as well as a system of actors communicating through messages.</p>

	<h2>Atomicity</h2>
	<p>To apply a transaction (data modification), a new tree is derived and uploaded onto the store. When ready, the hash of that new tree is added to the box, resulting in an atomic commit:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Adding the hash applies the transaction in its entirety.</li>
		<li>If adding fails, the old state is retained in its entirety.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Since the data is forward-moving, removing obsolete hashes is merely cosmetic, and only affects the performance.</p>
	<p>Note that the above atomicity directly depends on the atomicity of the store's <a href="/stores/store/#add-hash">add operation</a>. This is usually easy to accomplish, even for raw storage:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If all 32 bytes of the hash get correctly written to the storage system, the operation succeeds.</li>
		<li>If one or more bits are not written, or flipped, the resulting hash <a href="/notes/hash-collisions/">very likely</a> does not point to an existing object, and is therefore invalid. The old state remains.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Consistency</h2>
	<p>Each transaction moves the data from one valid state to another valid state of the forward-moving data structure. Higher-level constraints have to be implemented by the application.</p>

	<h2>Isolation</h2>
	<p>Multiple independent transactions may run concurrently, and won't affect each other. When reading the data, all changes are be merged.</p>

	<h2>Durability</h2>
	<p>A committed transaction is durable on the applied store, and will remain committed throughout the lifetime of the store.</p>
	<p>The lifetime of a store depends on the nature of the underlying storage system. On non-volatile storage, such as a hard disk or solid state drive, a store lives until the drive fails, or until the store is wiped. On volatile memory, such as RAM, a store lives until power is removed, or until the process managing the store exits.</p>
