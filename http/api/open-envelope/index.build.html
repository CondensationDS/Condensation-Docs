	<p>The <i>publicKeyCache</i> is used to cache public keys across multiple invocations. This greatly improves performance when receiving multiple messages from the same sender.</p>
	<p>In case of success, <i>contentReference</i> allows to retrieve the content from the <i>sender</i>'s store, and <i>envelope</i> contains the raw envelope record.</p>
	<p>If retrieval of the envelope object or the public key object failed with a store error, the operation fails with a store error. In this case, the envelope may be opened again later when the stores are available.</p>
	<p>If the envelope is incomplete, not properly signed, or not encrypted for the identity, the operation fails as <i>invalid</i>. In this case, the corresponding box entry should be removed. Opening the same envelope will also fail at a later point in time.</p -->
