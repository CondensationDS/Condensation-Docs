	<p>Transfers an <a href="/serialization/tree/">object tree</a> from one store to the other using the following algorithm:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="/api/store/#book">Book</a> the object on the destination store. If the object exists, the transfer is complete.</li>
		<li><a href="/api/store/#get">Get</a> the object from the source store, and keep it in memory.</li>
		<li>Recursively transfer all children and their subtree, one by one.</li>
		<li><a href="/api/store/#put">Put</a> the object onto the destination store.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>To reduce the memory footprint, objects are copied serially, and only one store operation is taking place at at time. The tree is traversed in depth-first order.</p>
	<p>If a store error occurs, the transfer stops immediately.</p>
	<p>If an object is not found on the source store (and could not be booked on the destination store), the transfer stops immediately.</p>
	<p>Transfers assume that the destination store uses <a href="/notes/complete-subtrees/">complete subtrees</a>. If an object is found on the destination store, it is assumed that all its children are available as well. New objects are put in child-first order.</p>
	<p class="java javascript">When the same subtree is transferred multiple times in parallel, the corresponding store operations are pooled and only executed once.</p>
