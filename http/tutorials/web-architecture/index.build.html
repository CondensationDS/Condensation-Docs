	<p>Websites have traditionally been server-driven, i.e. the bulk of the website's logic, and the bulk of the data processing involved has been done on the server, while web browsers merely displayed the final result. The reason is mostly historical: JavaScript engines used to be slow, and their compatibility across browsers used to be bad. The possibilities were limited.</p>
	<p>This is not the case any more. JavaScript engines are speedy, and browser compatibility has improved a lot. As a consequence, more and more websites are moving parts of the computation and logic from the server to the web browser (client). Today, most websites follow a hybrid model:</p>
	<p><? svgFile('HybridModel.svg') ?></p>
	<p>This hybrid model is convenient, but not very secure. In particular, the web server is exposed:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Storing private data of users, such as pictures, credit card information, or passwords</li>
		<li>Complex, hence a big chance that there are loopholes somewhere</li>
		<li>For many small websites, delicate information and public information reside next to each other, perhaps in the same database</li>
	</ul>
