	<h2>Working with encrypted objects</h2>

	<p>To store an encrypted object, the client</p>
	<ul>
		<li>generates a random 256-bit sequence to be used as AES key</li>
		<li>encrypts the object's data using that key (but leaves the links unencrypted)</li>
		<li>transmits the encrypted object to the server</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The server calculates the SHA-256 sum of the encrypted object, and returns this hash to the client. The client keeps the object hash alongside with the AES key.</p>
	<p>Note that the server is unable to decrypt the object, as it does not know the AES key. Hence, the links cannot be encrypted because the server must be able to follow them during <a href="/stores/store/#garbage-collection">garbage collection</a>. All linked objects should therefore be encrypted, too.</p>

	<p>To retrieve the object, the client</p>
	<ul>
		<li>downloads the encrypted object using the object hash</li>
		<li>checks its <a href="/notes/data-integrity/">integrity</a></li>
		<li>decrypts the data using the AES key</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Working with encrypted trees</h2>

	<p>Every object should be encrypted with a different AES key. Using the same AES key may compromise security if an object is reused in another tree later on.</p>
	<p>Typically, the AES key of child objects is stored in the (encrypted) data of their parent. This ensures that anyone with access to the parent can also access its children. To read the tree, one needs the tree hash (i.e. the hash of its root object) as well as the tree key (i.e. the AES key of the root object). To just download (or synchronize the tree), its hash is sufficient.</p>
