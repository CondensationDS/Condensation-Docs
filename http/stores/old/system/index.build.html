	<p>Condensation is a distributed data system, in which users (and services) store and share their data through <a href="/concepts/stores/">Condensation stores</a>:</p>

	<div class="todo">move this away from here, as this is not the most important thing; show use with asymmetric keys and symmetric keys later</div>
	<p>On each device, a user (or service) keeps a <a href="/concepts/actor/">actor</a>, consisting of a key pair, and optional public information. On each store, a user (or service) has an account for each of his/her identities.</p>
	<p>Data is serialized as immutable <a href="/specifications/object/">objects</a> and <a href="/concepts/trees/">trees</a>, and protected through end-to-end encryption.</p>

	<p style="margin-top:40px; font-style:italic">This section of the documentation contains a high-level description of Condensation. To find out how to use Condensation on a specific storage or communication system, check out the <a href="/">protocols section</a>.</p>
