	<p>Condensation protects the user's data through end-to-end encryption. The objects's data part is thereby encrypted before submission to a Condensation store, and decrypted only upon reception from a store.</p>
	<p>Encryption and decryption is done by the client. Condensation stores are unable to decrypt objects, and do not even make any distinction between encrypted and plain-text objects.</p>

	<h2>Encrypted objects</h2>
	<p>The object's data section is encrypted using <a href="/notes/cryptography/">AES 256</a> in CTR mode:</p>
	<div class="hscroll indent"><? svgFile('EncryptedObject.svg') ?></div>
	<p>Each object is encrypted with a different (random) key. The CTR counter starts at 0 at the beginning of the data section.</p>
	<p>The hash list remains unencrypted, so that Condensation stores can follow trees, and compile a list of all objects still in use.</p>

	<h2>Encrypted trees</h2>
	<p>Object trees are encrypted hierarchically, i.e. the parent object contains information on how to decrypt its children:</p>
	<div class="hscroll indent"><? svgFile('EncryptedTree.svg') ?></div>
	<p>Such information may include an encryption key and an initialization vector. Its encoding is application-specific.</p>
	<p>Anybody with access to an object also has access to its children, and therefore the whole subtree. A subtree can be shared by sharing its hash and all information required to decrypt its root object.</p>

	<h2>Envelopes</h2>
	<p>At tree roots, clear-text <a href="/specifications/envelope/">envelope</a> objects contain information on how to decrypt the root object:</p>
	<div class="hscroll indent"><? svgFile('Envelope.svg') ?></div>
	<p>Such envelopes usually contain a symmetric key encrypted with a password, a fingerprint, or another key of a symmetric or asymmetric encryption scheme. Envelopes may also contain signatures or password hints.</p>
