	<p>Cloud storage is ubiquitous, and has a lot of practical advantages. Users have access to their data anywhere, at any time, and on all their devices. Condensation offers all these advantages, too, but uses a different model.</p>

	<h2>Common cloud model</h2>
	<p>Common cloud storage services encrypt the data for transmission, but decrypt it on the server. Data transformation such as indexing is carried out on the server, and index queries require a connection to the server:</p>
	<p><? svgFile('CloudModel.svg') ?></p>
	<p>Data sharing is implemented using access rights management on the server.</p>
	<p>Note that some cloud storage services re-encrypt the data on their storage systems. This offers some security benefits to the provider, but does not substantially increase data security for the user.</p>

	<h2>Condensation model</h2>
	<p>Condensation relies on end-to-end encryption:</p>
	<p><? svgFile('CondensationModel.svg') ?></p>
	<p>The server is used for storage only. It does not possess the encryption keys, and therefore cannot decrypt the data.</p>
	<p>Data transformations are carried out on the client, and the result (e.g., the index) is end-to-end encrypted and stored just like any other data. As a side effect, index queries can be performed locally.</p>
	<p>Data sharing is implemented through a message passing scheme. The sender thereby encrypts the data using the public key of the receiver rather than his own public key.</p>
	<p>Similarly, data can be sent to (trusted) remote services for processing.</p>
